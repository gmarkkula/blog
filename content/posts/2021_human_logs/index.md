...

Logarithms... Perhaps easiest to think of as the inverse of exponentials... growth ... like the number of fruits in a tree as a function of time...

(tree growth animation - interactive?)

Logarithms are the inverse... Take a number, get the exponential of the number, apply a logarithm, and you'll get back your original number...

Humans make logarithms... Hicks studied speed of stimulus-response mappings ...

(Hicks 1952 plot)

Play the game below... score based on how good you are compared to the function Hicks found in 1952...

(Hicks fruit game)

But sensitive to exact task... cheat in game above...

Breaks the logarithm... Interestingly, there is still another logarithm at work here, in how quickly you are able to reach for the target location, as a function of how big it is and far away... A post for another day...

So why is there a logarithm here...? Hicks had his own thoughts about this... couched in terms of information theory which was really new and hot at the time... Title of the paper: "On the rate of gain of information"... in bits... One or zero... If you are specifying a higher number you need a larger number of bits... And how does the number of bits you need grow with the number of you want to specify? Logarithmically. And the reason for this is that again we get back to the idea of a tree...

So Hicks suggestion was that the brain is dealing with this decision situation by way of a kind of divide and conquer, iteratively dividing the search space for the right response into smaller and smaller parts. Intuitively, in the fruit game, this could be something like.... "I know the banana is in the right half... I know that it is in the lower part of the right half" ... And the fewer target locations you have to choose from, the quicker there will only be one location left, which will then be the right answer. So the "rate of gain of information" can be thought of as "how quick is the brain at iteratively dividing the search space?"...

So is the brain really doing something like this? That is a big and interesting question, and has been tackled by a lot of people in different ways... Somewhat of a benchmark for models of how the brain solves this type of decision challenge... Again a topic for a different post...
