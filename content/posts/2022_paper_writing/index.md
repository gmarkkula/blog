1. At some point before the final results are available: create a document for your paper. Sometimes I do this already while designing an experiment, sometimes later, but typically not later than during the early stages of data analysis
    * Just an empty working document to begin with, with top-level headings (Intro, Method, Results, Discussion)
2. While you are still in the results generation phase (designing/performing experiment, modelling, analysing data, ...)
    * Jot down notes as you go
    * Motivations for experiment design or analysis decisions (if you are not keeping track of them elsewhere)
    * Useful references you don't want to lose track of
    * Nice formulations that come to mind
3. When you have a good grasp yourself of what the results are saying, you want to decide what the high-level takeaways from the paper should be
    * Write a first draft of title and abstract, conveying one or a few key points
    * Create first drafts of all of the figures that you want in the paper to illustrate your key point(s) - but don't spend time on making them pretty yet
    * You may want to add in some approximate structure in the form of subheadings at this stage
    * Discuss this stuff with coauthors and others for feedback
    * If the outcome is that some of the analyses ought to change, go back to step 2 and continue there until you are ready for another stab at step 3.
4. When you know what the high-level takeaways are and how to convey them with your figures, it's time to shape the narrative in more detail - how you will go about convincing the reader about your key points in the text itself
    * Define the structure of the paper in full, with all subheadings
    * Write bullet-level contents, each bullet corresponding to about one paragraph, just noting the gist of what needs to be said there
    * Iterate the figures, to make them as pretty and easy to understand as you can
    * Consider getting feedback, or proceed
5. When you are happy with the overall shape of the narrative, it's time to think through its structure in more detail
    * Expand the bullet text to about one bullet per sentence in the final text. 
    * At this point some of the bullets might start looking like actual sentences - that's quite ok, but for me the bullet form helps me avoid trying to be perfectionist about the writing at this stage. It doesn't have to be well formulated or flow nicely.
    * The figures deserve another go - if you try to look at them with fresh eyes you'll probably find some more improvements you can make.
    * By now you should definitely consider getting feedback
6. Once you are happy with the narrative structure at about a per-sentence level, it is time to actually write
    * At this stage I typically find that it is quite easy to turn the bullets into decent text. Still no need to be perfectionist about it.
    * Continue touching up the figures.
    * Consider getting feedback, or proceed
7. And now you finish it off
    * Iterate the text until you are happy with it
    * Will you look at those figures. Can you believe you made those?
