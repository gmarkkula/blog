A stab at a blog with the loosely defined aim to talk about how human behaviour and maths relate to each other, in a way that is readable (and perhaps occasionally interesting) even if maths isn't part of your day job. 

More about me on [my Uni profile page](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/transport/staff/957/professor-gustav-markkula).

The use of Greek letters to spell the blog title is an idea lovingly stolen from [this tweet](https://twitter.com/o_guest/status/1254381182420123648) by [Olivia Guest](https://twitter.com/o_guest) (if you don't follow her on Twitter already you should).
